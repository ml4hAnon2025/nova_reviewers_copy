# NOVA code and benchmark for ML4H reviewers

In this repo, we provide a password protected zip file (see reviews for password) containing the code for NOVA and its tools as well as SlideQuest benchmark questions and answers. This repo is meant for inspection and discussion rather than running the code. 

We must provide a passowrd protected file containing the code because the code is undergoing internal company review processes that are mandatory before open sourcing. 

Please let us know if you have any questions for us.
